# hello-world
Hi, my name is Matthew Mallard but most people just know me as matbram. I'm a writer, turned web designer, recently turned web developer. I'm an entrepreneur at heart and love coming up with ideas that solve problems for people, allowing me to make their lives easier, while generating passive income for myself along the way.
